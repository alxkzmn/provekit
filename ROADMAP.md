## Milestone Details

### Milestone: Prototype (v0.1.0)
- [x] Compile Noir circuit containing only AssertZeros to R1CS.
- [x] Create satisfying witness

- [x] Recursively verify in Gnark.

---

### Milestone: MVP (v0.2.0)
- [ ] Support most Noir opcodes.
- [ ] Proofs are zero knowledge.
- [ ] Switch to Skyscraper V2.
- [ ] Optimized for performance and memory.
- [ ] Recursion service.

---

### Milestone: Release (v1.0.0)
- [ ] Use sparse evaluation proof in Gnark recursion.
- [ ] Review interfaces, documentation and test coverage.
- [ ] Code audit.
- [ ] Publish crates, deploy services.

---

### Milestone: Mersenne 31 (v1.0.0)
- [ ] Add M31 support to Noir.
- [ ] Adapt GR1CS to M31.
